Japanese text presents challenges for natural language processing due to its lack of spaces between words. A simple tokenization approach is to treat each character as a token, which works for some words written in Kanji. However, this method breaks down for words mixing Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana scripts, which is common. Although more complex, word-level tokenization is preferable for most Japanese NLP tasks. This abstract summarizes the issues with Japanese tokenization and argues that despite difficulties, word-level tokenization is worth pursuing for quality results.
